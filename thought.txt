1. I finished up to completing the datastructuress.

<div class="main">
        <form class="quizMain">
          <h4>question</h2>
          <button id="answerOne">Try to answer the following code quiz within the given time limit.
              Note : Incorrect answers will penalize your scoretime by ten seconds.
          </h4>
          <button id="startQuiz">Start</button>
        </form>


        Missing parts
        - Icons usage in correct or wrong answers
        - Need to consider why questions are iterating without having questions in the pool
        - Need to think of several javascripts or one js file
